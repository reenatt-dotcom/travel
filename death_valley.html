      Death Valley National Park is famous for its record-breaking temperatures, with scorching summers that can reach well over 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius).

Walk on the vast expanse of salt flats, marvel at the intricate salt formations, and gaze at the surrounding mountains that seem to rise dramatically from the valley floor.
